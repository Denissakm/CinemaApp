This application is made by Deniss Akmaikin for learning purposes. Uploaded: 12/10/2021. 

Possibilities of application:
1) Fetch XML data from Finnkino API
2) Make the table with all the movies in cinemas
3) Application has an option for user to choose city, cinema and date. 
4) Created table with movie shows depends on user's choice.
5) Application has randomizer function that randomly picks a show in random city for user with all the details.
6) Application has a search engine with user's input that allows user to find movie show by name.

<br/>{!} Details tab contains link to the movie page at Finnkino, not at the Event itself. 
<br/>{!} Search engine gives a link to the event page, not at the movie page 
<br/>{!} Search engine allows to look only for a Helsinki shows.

<br/>Evaluation:

<br/>Implement a web page, where the user can select a theater from a list - done
<br/>The page then shows the pictures and info of the ongoing movies in the selected theatre - done
<br/>Display some other info as well, such as showtimes etc - done
<br/>Create nice layout and style for the page - done (in my opinion :) )
<br/>Extra points will be given for input field with custom search string - done 
<br/>video presentation - done

<br/>I think that my application is good enough for this project, there is a lot of space for improvements, but I believe that main functions are done with a quite good quality.
