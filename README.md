Possibilities of application:

2) Make the table with all the movies in cinemas
3) Application has an option for user to choose city, cinema and date. 
4) Created table with movie shows depends on user's choice.
5) Application has randomizer function that randomly picks a show in random city for user with all the details.

Evaluation:

Implement a web page, where the user can select a theater from a list - done
The page then shows the pictures and info of the ongoing movies in the selected theatre - done
Display some other info as well, such as showtimes etc - done
Create nice layout and style for the page - done (in my opinion :) )
Extra points will be given for input field with custom search string - done 
video presentation - done

I think that my application is good enough for this project, there is a lot of space for improvements, but I believe that main functions are done with a quite good quality.
